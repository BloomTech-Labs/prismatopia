An API stack combining a bunch of super-awesome technologies: Apollo Server, Prisma, OAuth, OpenID Connect, JWT, Postgres, Docker, Typescript, AWS and more!

## How to use this repository

Step one is always to fork this repo!

Prismatopia is a reference implementation, meaning you can clone it, configure, run it and play with it. You make a copy of this repository and that copy becomes the backend for your application. You'll end up customizing your copy of this repository with your resolvers, schemas and other stuff. This repository is simply an empty vessel for you to fork or otherwise copy as the starting point for your API stack.

#### MacOS:

Install docker & docker-compose:
```
cd ~/prismatopia && ./macos.sh
```

## The Stack

This API is built as a very specific stack of technologies.bThere no options, other than configuring the existing stack components or swapping them out in your own copy. Enjoy!

Here are the technologies in this stack...

* AWS
  * Handles networking (ALB, VPC, etc.) and container management (ECS)
* Apollo Server 2
  * Provides a GraphQL server for resolvers, which is where your business logic lives
* Prisma
  * Provides an ORM to translate from Graphql to Postgres, Apollo resolvers mainly call a Prisma Client to access data
* Postgres
  * Provides persistent storage for data, this is managed by AWS RDS in production but is run in a container during local development
* Github
  * Provides a place to hold the source code
* OAuth
  * Apollo is setup for validating JWTs
* Docker
  * There's a local Docker Compose setup and AWS components (except Postgres) run in containers
* Typescript
  * The Apollo layer is Typescript

## The Codebase

The various components of this stack are organized into folders to help keep everything neat and tidy.

`.env`
You don't see this because you'll need to create it and load it up with your specific configurations. To get Prismatopia running for reference, you should create a `.env` file in the root directory that looks like this:

```bash
APPLICATION_NAME=donuts
ENVIRONMENT_NAME=stage

OAUTH_TOKEN_ENDPOINT=https://<your okta domain>.okta.com/oauth2/default
OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=<your okta client id>

PRISMA_MANAGEMENT_API_SECRET=<a big long gnarly secret string used to access the prisma management api>

PRISMA_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:7000/

PRISMA_SECRET=<another big long gnarly secret string used to access your application's prisma api>
```

`sourceme.sh`
A simple little script that will load the environment variables in `.env` into your shell environment. You need to source this for it to work: `source ./sourceme.sh`

`docker-compose.yml`
A Docker Compose file that brings Prismatopia up locally for you to play with and develop against. Use it by running `docker-compose up`

`.gitignore`
Very important to ensuing that you don't accidentally commit `.env` into your repository!

`Makefile`
Oh how do we love the Makefile! So handy! Anything you need to do with Prismatopia can be done from the make file...

Directories:

* [The Apollo Layer](apollo/README.md)
* [The Prisma Layer](prisma/README.md)
* [The AWS Layer](cloudformation/README.md)

## Running locally

TODO: Fix lazy loading of AWS variables

1. TODO: `make init`
   1. Install awscli
   2. Install docker
   3. Install prisma-cli (npm install -g prisma)
   4. Install prisma-cli (npm install -g apollo)
   5. Install local graphql-playground electron
2. Create an `.env` file in the root directory as described above
3. Run Prismatopia: `docker-compose up`

Prisma should be running now, you should see some output:

```shell
...
apollo_1    | Running at address :: on port 8000
...
prisma_1    | Server running on :7000
...
```

You should also be able to hit Prisma in the browser:

* GraphQL Playground: <http://localhost:7000/>
* Prisma Admin: <http://localhost:7000/_admin>

Though when you hit Apollo, you should get an authorization error:

* Apollo API: <http://localhost:8000/api/graphql>
  * `Authorization header _must_ contain bearer token in the format 'Bearer <\<Access Token (JWT)\>'`

Sweet! Now, you need to deploy something to Prisma, which starts out empty.

1. Load the environment variables into your shell: `source ./sourceme.sh`
2. Deploy the Prisma schema: `make local-prisma-deploy`
3. Generate a token: `make local-prisma-deploy`

You've now deployed and seeded the Prisma/Postgres layer. You can refresh your browser and use the generated token in GraphQL Playground and Prisma Admin. You should see data and you should be able to run some queried and mutations.

Getting into Apollo will be a bit trickier, since you need a valid JWT from an OAuth identity provider. In this case, we're using Okta, so you'll need to get a JWT from Okta.

1. Setup an application in Okta that uses the Client Credentials flow
2. Add the credentials to your `.env` file:

```shell
TEST_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=<the client id>
TEST_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=<the client secret>
```

3. Run `make apollo-token-gen` which will generate a token that can be sent to Apollo
4. Download and run GraphQL Playground as an Electron app, since Apollo doesn't expose it in Prismatopia
5. Use the access token from Okta to authorize with Apollo through the GraphQL Playground

## Running in AWS

1. Create the `.env` file
2. Edit the `cloudformation/params.json` file to your liking
3. Deploy to AWS: `make cf-aws-deploy-all`
4. Generate a token: `make prisma-token`
5. Play: `https://prisma.<your domain>`
